        <h1>Passwords</h1>
        <p>It’s important to mix things up—get creative with easy-to-remember ways to customize your standard password for different sites. Having different passwords for various accounts can help prevent cyber criminals from gaining access to these accounts and protect you in the event of a breach.</p>

        <h2>Usernames & Passwords</h2>
        <p>One of the most important things to first understand is why a majority of sites require you to have a username and a password. On the modern web, billions of people are interacting with eachother every second. While most of these interactions are neutral, there are many individuals who wish to take advantage of those who aren't prepared.

        If you were to use your full name for everything online, it would be very difficult to to have any privacy. Instead, you typically have a <b>Username</b>. This is one of the simplest ways to add a layer of security to any website or application. A username allows and individual to be identified by something other than their actual name. You want to avoid having any personal or sensitive information in your username. This includes your actual name, birth date, or anything else that may give potential wrong-doers a hint at your identity.

        In order to make sure only one person has access to a username, they're typically paired with a <b>Password</b>. A password is like a secret code that only the creator should know. They can include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and even special characters like question marks or symbols. While having a secure username is important, making sure your password is not easily guessable is one of the most simple yet powerful preventive measures you can take on to securing your privacy on the internet.

            <h2>General Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            In most cases, the only requirement for usernames is that they be unique to the platform you're registering on. For example, if you're attempting to make a google account with the username "john@gmail.com", if someone else already has that username, you'll be told so, and asked to change it. Another general requirement, unlike passwords, is that you're not allowed to use most special characters in a username. If you were to attempt to make a google account with the username "+john=_@gmail.com", you would be told your username has invalid characters. Usernames typically have <b>letters</b> and <b>numbers</b>.

                <br>

            Passwords, however, are generally only limited by a preset length. While not always required, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to make your password at least 8 characters long, and to use a mix of numbers, letters and symbols. The more complex your password is, the more difficult it will be for others to guess it.
